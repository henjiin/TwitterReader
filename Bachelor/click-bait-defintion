Problem: Journalistische Sprache -gerade bei überschriften- anders 


http://de.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=click+bait

An eyecatching link on a website which encourages people to read on. It is often paid for by the advertiser ("Paid" click bait) or generates income based on the number of clicks.
This is not news, really. It’s click bait, the stuff pageviews are made of.

OR

This is the worst article I've ever read, clearly from a massive Microsoft hater or paid by Apple/Google. It's just paid FUD clickbait, wouldn't expect any better of news.com.au. Source: Whirlpool Forum 21 Oct 2012.

(noun, pejorative) A seemingly innocent posting on social media that contains a link to more content, but whose true goal is to trick the viewer into clicking on the link so that the writer can collect view stats -- usually for monetary or for narcissistic purposes.
That tweet on how to get girls/guys was just clickbait -- it linked to some book on Amazon.

That posting in my stream titled "What This Person Did For That Will AMAZE You!" was just clickbait and linked to a paid advertisement video.

It means what you think it means: bait for clicks. It's a link which entices you to click on it.

The "bait" comes in many shapes and sizes, but it is usually intentionally misleading and/or crassly provocative. Clicking will inevitably cause disappointment. Clickbait is usually created for money.

One common type is adverts and spam, such as you might find on a random website or in your Facebook feed. Such clickbait usually leads to a site which tries to sell you something or possibly extort you, by withholding the promised "bait". Typical examples include: a sexy picture which promises to show more; suggestive and intriguing captions, like "you won't believe what this hot girl did"; stories designed to inflame people, such as by playing on political passions, like "woman demands more benefits to pay for comfort eating"; and claimed weight loss methods or body building methods, often with some "weird easy trick".

The second main variety is headlines to media sites which make money from page views. Common offenders are Buzzfeed, and Gawker and its affiliated sites. The headlines are designed to cause maximum provocation or interest, but as a result are frequently extremely exaggerated or flat out lies, and the articles themselves are often just as shoddy.
Thanks for wasting my time with this lying clickbait, random Gawker editor. Congratulations, you've gotten your two cents out of me. Now off you go and spend it on your favourite brand of cheap gin - the one you swill at night as you silently shed tears whilst contemplating your miserable, tortured existence and failed journalism career.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Clickbait is a pejorative term describing web content that is aimed at generating online advertising revenue, especially at the expense of quality or accuracy, relying on sensationalist headlines to attract click-throughs and to encourage forwarding of the material over online social networks. Clickbait headlines typically aim to exploit the "curiosity gap", providing just enough information to make the reader curious, but not enough to satisfy their curiosity without clicking through to the linked content.[1][2][3]

By 2014, the ubiquity of clickbait on the Internet had begun to lead to a backlash against its use.[3][4] Satirical newspaper The Onion launched a new website, ClickHole, that parodied clickbait websites such as Upworthy and Buzzfeed,[5] and in August 2014, Facebook announced that it was taking technical measures to reduce the impact of clickbait on its social network,[6][7][8] using, among other cues, the time spent by the user on visiting the linked page as a way of distinguishing clickbait from other content.[9]

Facebook’s goal is to distinguish between good click bait — catchy headlines that deliver real stories that back up the tabloid lure — and evil click bait — catchy headlines that are nothing more than a traffic generating bait-and-switch.

Click-Baiting Headlines

“Click-baiting” is when a publisher posts a link with a headline that encourages people to click to see more, without telling them much information about what they will see. Posts like these tend to get a lot of clicks, which means that these posts get shown to more people, and get shown higher up in News Feed

Alternatively referred to as link bait, clickbait or click bait is a term used to describe a type of hyperlink on a web page that entices a visitor to click to continue reading an article. Typically click bait links will forward the user to a page that requires payment, registration, or is one in a series of pages to help drive page views for the site.
Most click bait type links have catchy or provocative headlines that are difficult for most users to resist and often have little or nothing to do with the actual web page. For example, consider the two example links below, which point to the same page.
